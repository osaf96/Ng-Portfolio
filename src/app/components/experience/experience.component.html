            As part of the core team at Charter Communications(Offshore
            contractor), I contributed to the successful redevelopment of their
            main buyflow site using Node.js and Angular. This project resulted
            in a 10% increase in sales and a 30% reduction in page load time. I
            played a key role in scaling traffic from 10% to 100% by
            implementing architectural updates and optimizing SEO. My
            responsibilities included writing unit tests with Jest, integrating
            AWS S3 for scalable storage, and utilizing Adobe Target for
            personalized content. Additionally, I managed Splunk queries to
            monitor and analyze site performance.
